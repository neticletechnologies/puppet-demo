# Proxy to use when accessing the Uptrack server, of the form

# * host and port are the hostname/ip address and port number used to
#   connect to the proxy

# The proxy must support making HTTPS connections. If this is unset,
# Uptrack will look for the https_proxy, HTTPS_PROXY, and http_proxy
# environment variables in that order, and then finally look for a
# proxy setting in the system-wide GConf database, if available and
# enabled below.

# You can also set this to "None" to force Uptrack not to use a proxy,
# even if one is set in the environment.
